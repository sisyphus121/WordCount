When cellphone became popular many years ago, parents and school at first banned students to take cellphone into classroom, but now, even the small child has owned a cellphone. The use of cellphone can't be banned. For students, they get used to keeping cellphone at hand, but the overuse of it can be blamed to their parents. Some parents don't set good examples for their children. When they are together, they just leave cellphones to kids and let them kill the time. If they show the beautiful scenery around and teach kids to appreciate the world. Then cellphone won't take up their time.
